# Plasma

🎓 *Learning Objectives:*

- 1-POM-2-4: Blood plasma: Recall the major components of plasma, summarise their functions, and explain the main types of exchange between plasma and body fluids across the capillary wall.

---

## Plasma

- The liquid component of blood
- Blood is taken into a tube with an anticoagulant

### Serum

- Plasma without clotting factors
- Blood is taken without anticoagulant → allowed to clot → centrifuged
- Cleaner sample than plasma, but takes longer to prepare

## Types of fluid compartments

(40L of water in 70kg adult male - 55% intracellular, 45% extracellular)

- Intracellular (within cells)
- Interstitial fluid (between cells)
- Transcellular fluid ( e.g. includes CSF, ocular, synovial fluid)
- Blood plasma

## Functions of plasma

- **Clotting** - clotting factors and Von Willebrand factor
- **Osmotic pressure maintenance** - proteins help maintain colloidal osmotic pressure
- **Immune defence** - antibodies and complement proteins are found in plasma
- **Endocrine** - many hormones are soluble in plasma and travel through blood to target organs
- **Metabolism** - nutrients such as glucose, amino acids and vitamins transported
- **Excretion** - waste products are transported via plasma fraction of the blood to the kidneys for removal

# Constituents of plasma

## Proteins

Assayed using electrophoresis

Major types of plasma proteins are:

- **Serum albumin**
- **Globulins** → alpha-1, alpha-2, beta-1, beta-2, gamma-globulin

### Serum albumin

Produced in liver

- Maintains osmotic pressure
- Transports lipids, hormones and ions
- Transport of fatty acids (from breakdown of triglycerides in adipose tissue) to be used for 𝛃-oxidation

### Globulins

| Protein type | Examples | Function |
| --- | --- | --- |
| alpha-1 globulin | Alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) | Protease inhibitor, inhibits neutrophil elastase from damage |
| alpha-2 globulin | Haptoglobin

α2-macroglobulin | Binds to haemoglobin released from RBCs, spleen then removes haptoglobin-haemoglobin complex

Protease inhibitor, inactivates fibrinolysis |
| beta globulin | Transferrin | Transports iron |
| gamma globulin | Immunoglobulins (antibodies)

C-reactive protein | Immunoregulatory

Acute-phase protein |

## Electrolytes

Helps maintain osmolarity

### Intracellular

- K+
- Mg2+
- PO4

### Extracellular

- Na+
- Cl-
- Ca2+
- HCO3-

ATP used to power Na+K+ATPase, to maintain negative membrane potential

If there is not enough ATP, an inward movement of sodium ions and water causes cells to become more spherical

# Plasma uses

- Biomarkers → key molecules within plasma provide biomarkers of disease
- Passive immunotherapy → transferring immunoglobulins for immunity
