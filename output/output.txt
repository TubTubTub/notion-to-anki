"<h4>Plasma →</h4><h2>Plasma</h2>"|"
- The liquid component of blood
- Blood is taken into a tube with an anticoagulant

"
"<h4>Plasma →  Plasma →</h4><h2>Serum</h2>"|"
- Plasma without clotting factors
- Blood is taken without anticoagulant → allowed to clot → centrifuged
- Cleaner sample than plasma, but takes longer to prepare

"<h4>Plasma →</h4><h2>Types of fluid compartments</h2>"|"
(40L of water in 70kg adult male - 55% intracellular, 45% extracellular)

- Intracellular (within cells)
- Interstitial fluid (between cells)
- Transcellular fluid ( e.g. includes CSF, ocular, synovial fluid)
- Blood plasma

"
"<h4>Plasma →</h4><h2>Functions of plasma</h2>"|"
- **Clotting** - clotting factors and Von Willebrand factor
- **Osmotic pressure maintenance** - proteins help maintain colloidal osmotic pressure
- **Immune defence** - antibodies and complement proteins are found in plasma
- **Endocrine** - many hormones are soluble in plasma and travel through blood to target organs
- **Metabolism** - nutrients such as glucose, amino acids and vitamins transported
- **Excretion** - waste products are transported via plasma fraction of the blood to the kidneys for removal

"
"<h4>Constituents of plasma →</h4><h2>Proteins</h2>"|"
Assayed using electrophoresis

Major types of plasma proteins are:

- **Serum albumin**
- **Globulins** → alpha-1, alpha-2, beta-1, beta-2, gamma-globulin

Produced in liver

- Maintains osmotic pressure
- Transports lipids, hormones and ions
- Transport of fatty acids (from breakdown of triglycerides in adipose tissue) to be used for 𝛃-oxidation

/ Protein type / Examples / Function /
/ --- / --- / --- /
/ alpha-1 globulin / Alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) / Protease inhibitor, inhibits neutrophil elastase from damage /
/ alpha-2 globulin / Haptoglobin

α2-macroglobulin / Binds to haemoglobin released from RBCs, spleen then removes haptoglobin-haemoglobin complex

Protease inhibitor, inactivates fibrinolysis /
/ beta globulin / Transferrin / Transports iron /
/ gamma globulin / Immunoglobulins (antibodies)

C-reactive protein / Immunoregulatory

Acute-phase protein /

"<h4>Constituents of plasma →  Electrolytes →</h4><h2>Extracellular</h2>"|"
- Na+

- HCO3-

ATP used to power Na+K+ATPase, to maintain negative membrane potential

If there is not enough ATP, an inward movement of sodium ions and water causes cells to become more spherical
